# ☁️ AWS Static Website Hosting Project

It demonstrates how to **host a static portfolio website using Amazon Web Services (AWS)** — specifically **S3 for storage** and optionally **CloudFront for global content delivery and HTTPS**.

The project includes a responsive HTML/CSS design, GitHub version control, and clear documentation for deploying and configuring AWS services for website hosting.
