# ☁️ AWS Static Website Hosting Project
This project is part of my cloud engineering learning journey. It demonstrates how to host a static portfolio website using Amazon Web Services (AWS) — specifically S3 for storage and optional CloudFront for global content delivery and HTTPS.

The project includes a simple responsive HTML/CSS design, GitHub version control, and clear documentation that explains how to deploy and configure AWS services for website hosting.

Skills Demonstrated:

AWS S3 bucket setup and configuration

Public access and IAM policies

Static website hosting

Version control with Git & GitHub

Optional: CloudFront CDN + HTTPS setup

Tech Stack:

HTML, CSS

Amazon S3, CloudFront

Git & GitHub

This project represents the foundation of a cloud engineer’s skillset — deploying and managing a real application on AWS infrastructure.
